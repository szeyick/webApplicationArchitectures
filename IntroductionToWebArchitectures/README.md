###Web Services, what are they?

In the most basic sense, a web service defines the method of communication between two devices over a network. Such examples of this would be a client browser and a remote server.

It provides a function, hence the name **service** and works similar to a request/response mechanism.

### Real World Examples

#### Online Purchasing
When we purchase items online (eBay, Amazon etc), we usually perform these tasks through a web browser. When we finalise the purchase and pay, we send a response off with the purchase information to a remote server that processes the sale.

Information in the request that we send can contain -

1. Buyer address.
2. Item name and quantity.
3. Credit card information.
