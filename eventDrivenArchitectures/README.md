# Event Driven Architectures

## Organisms Sense and Response: EDA

The idea is to sense what is around you and make a decision on what to do. This is the concept behind event driven architectures, where you react to a particular thing.

The streams of data or event, are triggered from an external source, such as from senses (sight, sound, touch, etc).

## Internet of Things (IoT)

Devices are now more interconnected, providing the state of the environment that they are in. It provides a more responsive environment since you can get updates in real-time.
